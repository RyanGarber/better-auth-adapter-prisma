# Better Auth adapter for Prisma 8

A PostgreSQL adapter for **Prisma 8.0.0-rc.10** and **Better Auth 1.7.4**, based on the behavior of Better Auth's Prisma 7 adapter. Uses Prisma 8's contract-driven ORM, including extension codecs, instead of the legacy Prisma Client API.

Supports CRUD, filtering, selections, pagination, ordering, transactions, joins, numeric/UUID identifiers, and additional fields. PostgreSQL is the supported target; this package does not implement the separate MongoDB API or claim SQLite/MySQL support.

## Install

```sh
pnpm add @ryangarber/better-auth-adapter-prisma better-auth@1.7.4 @better-auth/core@1.7.4 @prisma/orm-postgres@8.0.0-rc.10 temporal-polyfill
```

Prisma RC versions are pinned because their query and generated-type APIs change between releases. The adapter does not create a database connection or close your client; pass your application's existing client with its runtime extensions registered.

```ts
// auth.ts
import "temporal-polyfill/global"; // Required by Prisma DateTime codecs on runtimes without Temporal.
import { betterAuth } from "better-auth";
import { prismaAdapter } from "@ryangarber/better-auth-adapter-prisma";
import { db } from "./prisma/db";

export const auth = betterAuth({
  database: prismaAdapter(db),
  emailAndPassword: { enabled: true },
});
```

Both `prismaAdapter` and `prisma8Adapter` name the same factory. Author and emit your `contract.prisma`, then provision it using Prisma's normal database/migration workflow. This package does not implement Better Auth CLI schema generation. A complete test contract containing the four authentication models is in [test/fixtures/contract.prisma](test/fixtures/contract.prisma); remove its example additional fields if you do not need them.

## Additional fields and extension codecs

Declare additional fields in both the Prisma contract and Better Auth. The adapter passes their values through Prisma's ORM so the configured codec handles encoding and decoding. It does not JSON-stringify, clone nested values, or deserialize extension fields itself. Nullable fields, arrays, enums, branded values, and structured JSON retain their Prisma codec behavior.

For example, using [the Zod extension](https://github.com/ryangarber/prisma-orm-extension-zod):

```sh
pnpm add @ryangarber/prisma-orm-extension-zod@0.1.2 zod
pnpm add -D @prisma/orm-toolchain@8.0.0-rc.10
```

```ts
// prisma/schemas.ts — colocated with the emitted contract.d.ts
import { z } from "zod";
import type { CodecTypes } from "@ryangarber/prisma-orm-extension-zod/codec-types";
import { createZodExtension, defineZodSchema } from "@ryangarber/prisma-orm-extension-zod/column-types";

export const Profile = z.object({
  name: z.string(),
  age: z.string().transform(Number),
});
const schemas = { Profile: defineZodSchema(Profile) };
export type SchemaTypes = CodecTypes<typeof schemas>;
export const profileExtension: ReturnType<typeof createZodExtension> = createZodExtension(schemas, {
  module: "./schemas",
  export: "SchemaTypes",
});
```

```ts
// prisma.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from "@prisma/orm-postgres/config";
import { profileExtension } from "./prisma/schemas";

export default defineConfig({
  contract: "./prisma/contract.prisma",
  extensions: [profileExtension.control],
});
```

Add this field to your `User` model:

```prisma
profile zod.Json("Profile")
```

Emit the contract with `pnpm exec prisma contract emit`. Register the matching runtime extension:

```ts
// prisma/db.ts
import "temporal-polyfill/global";
import postgres from "@prisma/orm-postgres/runtime";
import type { Contract } from "./contract";
import contractJson from "./contract.json" with { type: "json" };
import { profileExtension } from "./schemas";

export const db = postgres<Contract>({
  contractJson,
  url: process.env.DATABASE_URL,
  extensions: [profileExtension.runtime],
});
```

### Infer custom user types

Better Auth 1.7.4 infers `type: "json"` as a generic record and does not derive additional-field types from validators or database adapters. Use `prismaUserFields` to bridge the emitted Prisma types into your direct server API:

```ts
import { betterAuth } from "better-auth";
import { prismaAdapter, prismaUserFields } from "@ryangarber/better-auth-adapter-prisma";
import { db } from "./prisma/db";

export const userFields = prismaUserFields(db.orm.public.User)({
  profile: { type: "json", required: true },
});

export const auth = userFields.inferAuth(betterAuth({
  database: prismaAdapter(db),
  emailAndPassword: { enabled: true },
  user: { additionalFields: userFields.additionalFields },
}));

const result = await auth.api.signUpEmail({
  body: {
    email: "ada@example.com",
    name: "Ada",
    password: "a sufficiently long password",
    profile: { name: "Ada", age: "36" }, // Write input: string.
  },
});
result.user.profile.age; // Read output: number.

type User = typeof auth.$Infer.Session.user;
// User["profile"] is { name: string; age: number }.
```

Use the actual namespace and an unprojected collection. The helper validates field names at compile time, including a field's optional `fieldName` mapping. It reads the contract's **input** type map separately from the collection's output type: Prisma 8.0.0-rc.10's create signatures alone are insufficient for codecs with different input/output types.

The helper preserves `required`, `input: false`, `returned: false`, and defaulted input optionality. It types `signUpEmail` and `updateUser` bodies, full user objects returned by server endpoints, and `auth.$Infer.Session.user`. Standard response/header/status options remain available. It returns the same auth object at runtime, and checks that its `additionalFields` object was installed on that instance.

Declare custom structured values as `type: "json"`. Use `type: "date"` for ordinary JavaScript `Date` fields. Keep any Better Auth `transform` or transforming `validator.input` consistent with the codec's input/output: those run independently of Prisma, and the helper does not infer their effects. In particular, passing the transforming `Profile` schema above as a Better Auth input validator would convert `age` before Prisma receives it; let the Prisma codec validate it instead.

For the client, keep Better Auth's `inferAdditionalFields` plugin and wrap the client with `inferPrismaClient`. The `/client` entry point has no server runtime dependencies; import the server field helper only as a type:

```ts
import { createAuthClient } from "better-auth/client";
import { inferAdditionalFields } from "better-auth/client/plugins";
import { inferPrismaClient } from "@ryangarber/better-auth-adapter-prisma/client";
import type { auth, userFields } from "./auth";

export const authClient = inferPrismaClient<typeof userFields>()(createAuthClient({
  plugins: [inferAdditionalFields<typeof auth>()],
}));

await authClient.signUp.email({
  email: "ada@example.com",
  name: "Ada",
  password: "a sufficiently long password",
  profile: { name: "Ada", age: "36" },
});
const session = await authClient.getSession();
session.data?.user.profile.age; // number
```

This preserves codec input/output types on signup, updates, session results, and `$Infer.Session`. Where the field helper is already available at runtime, `userFields.inferClient(client)` provides the same type view. Both wrappers return the original client unchanged. Better Auth's plugin alone still uses its primitive field inference.

**Scope of inference:** these helpers do not change Better Auth's hook/context types or plugin-defined input bodies. Standard JSON HTTP responses also have different semantics from decoded database values: JSON turns dates into strings, cannot serialize `bigint`, and does not preserve `Map`/`Set` instances. Use JSON-compatible public fields or an explicit serializer/client type layer for those values; the adapter and helper do not install an HTTP serializer. Cookie caching and other serialized stores have the same transport considerations.

## Names and defaults

| Setting | Default | Behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `provider` | `"postgresql"` | PostgreSQL contract required. |
| `usePlural` | `false` | Same as the original adapter. When enabled, Better Auth appends `s`, including to custom `modelName` values. |
| Model lookup | Exact, then lower-first alias | `user` resolves to contract model `user` or `User`, matching Prisma 7 delegate naming. Exact matches take precedence. No general case folding or English pluralization. |
| `namespace` | Unspecified | Search contract namespaces; reject ambiguous model names. |
| `models` | Unspecified | Map a resolved Better Auth name to an exact contract model name or `{ namespace, model }`. |
| `transaction` | `false` | Same as the original adapter. Enable to bind Better Auth transaction callbacks to Prisma transactions. |
| `debugLogs` | `false` | Better Auth adapter logging. |

`user.modelName`, `session.modelName`, plugin model names, built-in `fields` mappings, and additional-field `fieldName` mappings remain Better Auth options. They refer to **Prisma model and model-field names**. Prisma itself resolves storage names from `@@map` and `@map`; SQL table capitalization is not guessed by the adapter.

```ts
betterAuth({
  database: prismaAdapter(db, {
    namespace: "auth",
    usePlural: true,
    transaction: true,
    models: {
      persons: { namespace: "auth", model: "AuthPerson" },
      sessions: "LoginSession",
    },
  }),
  user: {
    modelName: "person", // becomes "persons" with usePlural
    fields: { name: "displayName" },
    additionalFields: {
      profile: { type: "json", fieldName: "profileData" },
    },
  },
});
```

Explicit `models` mappings are exact: a misspelling fails rather than silently falling back. The same resolution applies inside transactions and joins. Joins use Better Auth's foreign-key metadata and separate ORM queries, so they do not require guessed Prisma relation-property names. They are not single-statement SQL joins; use a suitable transaction/isolation strategy if your application needs a consistent snapshot across those reads.

## Query behavior

- Equality, inequality, comparisons, `in`/`not_in`, and string contains/prefix/suffix filters are supported. Case-insensitive string filters use database `lower(...)`; LIKE wildcard characters are escaped as literals.
- AND conditions are combined with the OR group, matching the original adapter. Null list members are removed; an empty `in` matches nothing and an empty `not_in` matches everything.
- Operations use Prisma's codec-aware predicates. A codec must advertise the comparison/order traits needed by a query. Codec, database, and constraint errors propagate.
- Single-row updates/deletes affect at most one match. Missing updates return `null`; missing deletes are no-ops. Better Auth guards empty single-row mutation predicates.
- Bulk updates/deletes use affected-row counts. Better Auth's built-in compare-and-swap fallbacks implement guarded increments and single-use consumption using these atomic operations. Prisma's single-row read-then-write methods are not advertised as atomic guarded operations.
- Built-in PostgreSQL `DateTime`/Temporal and date-string codecs are adapted on Better Auth `date` fields to/from JavaScript `Date`, including filters. Timestamp-without-time-zone values are treated as UTC. Custom extension codecs are not converted.

## Development and verification

```sh
pnpm install
pnpm typecheck
pnpm typecheck:contract  # Generated Prisma declarations, with skipLibCheck disabled.
pnpm lint
pnpm build
pnpm test

# Explicit opt-in; creates a unique ba_test_* schema and drops it in finally/afterAll.
ADAPTER_TEST_DATABASE_URL=postgresql://localhost:5432/postgres pnpm test
```

Live tests require PostgreSQL and `psql`. They emit the fixture contract, provision isolated tables, exercise real codecs and Better Auth, and clean up their schema. They cover storage names, mappings, rich values, different input/output types, date conversion, filtering, pagination, joins, rollback, concurrent consumption/increments, and signup/session/update. They do not test Prisma migrations or production contract signing; the isolated fixture runtime disables marker verification.

The ordinary project check retains the scaffold's `skipLibCheck` setting because Better Auth's optional platform declarations have unrelated compatibility issues. The separate contract check validates all generated Prisma field maps and their dependencies without that setting, and the type tests assert concrete input/output types and rejected invalid inputs.

Regenerate the committed type fixture with `node test/fixtures/emit.ts`. Generated files should not be edited manually.
